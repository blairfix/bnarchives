<xpage:title>Overview</xpage:title>
<xpage:body>
<p>This is an introductory guide to the theory of capital as power (CasP). It is intended primarily for those who are new to the subject and want to know where to begin.</p>
<p>CasP offers a radical alternative to mainstream and Marxist theories of value and capitalism. It argues that capital symbolizes and quantifies not utility or labour, but organized power writ large, and that capitalism is best understood and challenged not as a mode of production and consumption, but as a mode of power.</p>
<p>An accessible introduction to this approach is offered in Dutkiewicz&rsquo;s 2013 interview with Bichler and Nitzan. The interivew spells out some of the main arguments of CasP, contrasts these arguments with liberal and radical approaches to political economy, and situtates the various debates in the historical context of capitalist development:</p>

<p>Over the years, CasP has developed into an expanding project, with a growing number of contributions by various researchers from around the world. The following two articles and video presentation examine the past, present and future of this project. They trace the evolution of CasP from its inception in the 1980s, canvas the breadth of ongoing CasP research (and offer a detailed bibliography), propose future research trajectories, and contemplate the connecton between CasP theory and praxis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
